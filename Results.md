#### Niger Geospatial Livelihood Analysis of World Bank LSMS Data Results  
===
The figures below summarize the logistic regression analysis conducted on the LSMS data. The forest plot can be read as follows:
* The circle is the coefficient estimate.  
* The horizontal line going through each circle is the confidence intervale of the estimate.
* The values on the x-axis are raw coeficient values. These can be transformed into odds-ratios by exponentiating them.
