As part of the project we were asked to create a few reference products. To visualize the bulging population of Niger we create a population pyramid using R and data from the World Bank.

The code to create the graphic follows:  

`#Make a population pyramid graph for Niger`
```library(plotrix)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(colorRamps)```


```display.brewer.all()```
