Using the World Bank's 2011/12 National Household Living Conditions and Agriculture Survey for Niger, the GeoCenter analyzed the spatial dimensions of vulnerability to test how well vulnerability to external shocks could explained by household, community, and geographic data. To reproduce the analysis, clone the repository, set the appropriate working directory and run the .do files in the following order. The .do files work best if copied into the ```ProjectPath\\Dofiles\\``` folder that is created after running the setup file. Download and unzip the raw WB LSMS data to the ```Datain``` folder.\r\n\r\n* 00_SetupFolderGlobals.do  \r\n* 01_hhchar.do\r\n* 02_hhinfrastructure.do\r\n* 03_hhnatcap.do\r\n* 04_hhpc.do\r\n* 05_transfers.do\r\n* 06_shocks.do\r\n* 07_foodsecurity.do\r\n* 08_commservices.do\r\n* 09_ShockAnalysis.do  \r\n  \r\nR files  \r\n* The two R files (SpatReg.R and ShocksGraphs.R) can be used to reproduce the spatial filter model results and the forest plots, respectively.   \r\n  \r\nPython files  \r\n* I am working on a Python script to reproduce all to the interpolated surfaces using [Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK)][2].    \r\n\r\nQuestions: tessam[at]usaid.gov    \r\n\r\n[1]: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTLSMS/EXTSURAGRI/0,,contentMDK:23353883~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:7420261,00.html.  \r\n[2]: http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//0031000000q9000000   ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
